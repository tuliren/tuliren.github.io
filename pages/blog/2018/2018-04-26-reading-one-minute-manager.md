## Summary
![summary](/images/2018-04-26-reading-one-minute-manager/summary.jpg)

## Effective managers
- Manage themselves and the people they work with.
- Both the organization and the people profit from their presence.

## Productivity
- Both quantity and quality.
- The best way to achieve both is through people.

## Motto
- People who feel good about themselves produce good results.
- Help people reach their full potential and catch them doing something right.
- Everyone is a potential winner. Some people are disguised as losers. Don't let their appearances fool you.
- Take a minute, look at your goals, look at your performance, see if your behavior matches your goals.
- We are not just our behavior. We are the person managing our behavior.
- Goals begin behaviors. Consequences maintain behaviors.

## One minute goals
- Agree on your goals.
  - Focus on only the 20% important goals.
- Describe the problem using behavioral terms.
  - What is actually happening.
  - What is desired to be happening.
- Record the goal and performance standard.
  - On a single page using less than 250 words.
  - Each goal requires only a minute to read.
- Take a minute every once in a while out of the day to look at your performance.
  - Check if your behavior matches your goal.

## Why one minute goal works
- Number one motivator of people is feedback on results.

## One minute praisings
- Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing.
- Catch people doing something right and praise them immediately
  - Tell them:
    - What they did right -- be specific.
    - How good you feel about what they did right.
    - How it helps the organization and other people
  - Stop for a moment of silence to let them feel how good you feel.
  - Encourage them to do more of the same.
  - Make it clear that you support their success in the organization.

## Why one minute praising works
- The key to train someone to do a new task is, in the beginning, to catch them doing something approximately right and gradually moving them towards the desired behavior.
- Punishment won't help people move towards their goals.
- If inexperienced people don't perform, go back to one minute goals and make sure they understand what is expected of them, and that they have seen what good performance looks like.

## One minute reprimand
- Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms.
- First half
  - Reprimand people immediately.
  - Tell people
    - What they did wrong -- be specific.
    - How you feel about what they did wrong -- in no uncertain terms.
  - Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel.
- Second half
  - Let them know you are honestly on their side.
  - Remind them how much you value them.
  - Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation.
  - Realize that when the reprimand is over, it is over.

## Why one minute reprimand works
- The feedback is immediate. Unless discipline occurs as close to the misbehavior as possible, it tends not to be as helpful in influencing future behavior.
- If managers would only intervene early, they could deal with one behavior at a time and the person receiving the discipline would not be overwhelmed.
- Reprimand the behavior only. The feedback is about the specific behavior and not people's feeling about themselves as human beings. The goal is to eliminate the behavior and keep the person.
- It works if you are first tough on the behavior, and then supportive of the person.
- Behavior and worth are not the same things. It is really worthwhile that people manage their own behaviors.

## Source of power
- The genuine care for people.
